# BackoffRecovery

A recovery behavior for move_base which when executed backs off to create moveable space.

## Parameters

`~backoff_distance(double, default:0.2)`
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Amount of distance robot should backoff to create space.

`~vel(double, default:0.1)`
<br>&emsp;&emsp;At what velocity to move while backing off.

## Usage

clone and build the package within your workspace,

Verify the availability of the package,
```
rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core
```

Following line should be present within the response with path to your workspace,
```
backoff_recovery /<path_to_ws>/src/backoff_recovery/backoff_plugin.xml
```

Move base needs to be registered to use this plugin, a list containing recovery behaviors to be used should be passed as a parameter. To set the params within the WaitRecovery behavior a `.yaml` file can be loaded.


```
<launch>

    <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
     <!-- Other ros params and remaps -->

      <rosparam file="$(find <your_package>)/param/recovery_params.yaml" command="load" />

        <param name="recovery_behaviors" value="[
                {name: conservative_reset, type: clear_costmap_recovery/ClearCostmapRecovery}, 
                {name: wait, type: wait_recovery/WaitRecovery},
                {name: backoff, type: backoff_recovery/BackoffRecovery}
            ]" type="yaml" />
    
    </node>
  </launch>
```

Contents within the `.yaml` file,

```
# Backoff

backoff_distance: 0.5
vel: 0.2
```


## Why Backoff Recovery?

Not always will the robot be able to find valid local path by performing rotate in place recovery. The robot must backoff a little bit to follow a valid trajectory generated by local planner.
